Suppose we have an imaginary early-stage startup (pre-Series B) in San Francisco. It was founded by the CEO and her best friend from engineering school, the CTO. Let’s say that I’m the HR Manager at the startup. Given the limited resources, I wear multiple hats including recruiting, onboarding, offboarding, compliance, employee relations, and in this case, compensation analysis. I’m tasked to design the performance bonus structure and adjust salaries where needed, according to a $750K annual budget for bonuses.

Since real market compensation reports like Radford and Mercer are costly and company compensation data isn’t available to the public, I will base my analysis on hypothetical employee data generated by DeepSeek.

In this exercise, I used the following industry standard formulas:
Compa-Ratio = Current Annual Base Salary / Market Median Salary
Individual Bonus = Base Salary × Target Bonus % × (Performance Multiplier + Market Adjustment Factor + Level Multiplier)

By using Excel’s VLOOKUP, conditional statements, and other shortcuts, the spreadsheet automatically updates the bonus and shows how far we are from the budget based on any real-time adjustments.

Note: If the goal is to incentivize employees to get promoted and reward high performers, we can stick to the budget with the bonus structure highlighted in the tabs of the spreadsheet. If we want to motivate collaboration and teamwork, then I can add a Team Performance Multiplier to the Individual Bonus formula above. It’s important to note that the CEO, CTO, and their level 3 software engineer are paid above the market. It is common for startups to overpay their founders as it requires a lot of extra hats to ramp up the firm before more staff is hired. I will bring this up in a discussion with the CEO if they are short on budget. For now, I’ll adjust the bonus instead of decreasing their salaries. Decreasing their salary wouldn’t leave a good experience for this employee and risk their retention.
